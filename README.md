# One-Day-Shipping

One Day Shipping is an exciting arcade-style, low poly, 3D platformer that blends the fast-paced action of games such as Crazy Taxi with the flexible platforming feel of the greatest 3D platforming games. Download the executable file at the bottom of this readme file to play the game.

### Game Story
One Day Shipping is the story of Larry Noodleman, an unfortunately lanky postal delivery man just trying to do his job. You will be playing his first five days of work, where you have to deliver packages for the new startup company in The City. Since you are the only delivery person for this company, you have to deliver said packages no matter what. During this game you will encounter some of the postal men's worst enemies - aggressive dogs, lots of traffic, and terrible weather. You will also gradually make the main company that dominates package delivery in The City, The Postal Service, angrier and angrier until they eventually throws their packages at you and makes it rain flaming packages from the sky.    

### Project Info
One Day Shipping began development on October 1st with an ideation session and project structuring meeting. We used Agile Methodologies as the workflow strategy, and used Asana for project management and task delegation. We finished the development of One Day Shipping on December 12th.

### Future Work
The game has some known bugs and needs more polishing before it can be published. Below is a list of the work that needs to be done:

- Some characters are in the uncanny valley. Go more cartoony.
- Intro screen needs more visual interest. Maybe go with a more FedEx, Purolator, Post Office style. And find a ”postal font” that you use through out.
- Make some of the interface elements (clock, arrow) more postal in style, if possible.
- Character motions in this game are tricky. We want it to feel elastic and satisfying to play. We need to emphasize the snap back and squash in the bouncy motion. It needs to be more definite even while being elastic.
- The game is a bit flat in terms of surfaces.  Maybe go with a simple painterly style, with some texture but with plateaued color ranges without going overboard with textures.
- A more interested painted sky would be good to add.
- When the main character stops running he shrinks but it doesn’t look right.
- The camera needs more sophistication to avoid going through walls. Or make the wall semi-transparent.  Either way it needs to look intentional and not just a rough edge of the game.
- When the main character hits a car he sometimes floats in the air. This is a bug that must be fixed.
- Change the motion of the evil postmen to look more like uptight postmen.
- Include more outdoor advertisement and add more objects to the environment (benches, hiking trails, garbage bins, etc)
- Consider giving the individual packages more personality and story to them.

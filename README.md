# One-Day-Shipping

One Day Shipping is the story of Larry Noodleman, an unfortunately lanky postal delivery man just trying to do his job. You will be playing his first five days of work, where you have to deliver packages for the new startup company in The City. Since you are the only delivery person for this company, you have to deliver said packages no matter what. During this game you will encounter some of the postal men's worst enemies - aggressive dogs, lots of traffic, and terrible weather. You will also gradually make the main company that dominates package delivery in The City, The Postal Service, angrier and angrier until they eventually throws their packages at you and makes it rain flaming packages from the sky.

At this meeting, our team began brainstorming the concept of our game, as well as the development tools that we would use. We chose to work using the agile methodology, and structured our project development into four sprints
